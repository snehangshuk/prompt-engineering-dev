    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Block 1: 🎭 Set the Expert Persona\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it looked like:**\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<role>\n",
    "Act as a Senior Software Engineer specializing \n",
    "in Python backend services. Your expertise covers \n",
    "security, performance, reliability, and design.\n",
    "</role>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this does:** Activates the model's knowledge of senior-level software engineer. Instead of generic feedback, you get insights a seasoned engineer would catch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module 2 Tactic:** Role Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Block 2: 📦 Provide Context (What to Analyze)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it looked like:**\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<context>\n",
    "Repository: analytics-platform\n",
    "Service: Reporting API\n",
    "Purpose: Add monthly invoice exporter\n",

    "  ...\n",
    "</code_diff>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this does:** Separates \"what you're reviewing\" from \"how to review it.\" The AI knows the code belongs to a reporting service (so performance matters), it's for finance (so correctness and security are critical).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module 2 Tactic:** Structured Inputs (XML)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Block 3: 🔢 Define Review Dimensions (What to Check)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it looked like:**\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<review_guidelines>\n",
    "Assess across multiple dimensions:\n",

    "1. Security — SQL injection, S3 exposure\n",

    "### 🎨 A Quick Note on Formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have noticed we used XML tags (`<role>`, `<context>`) instead of Markdown. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key principle:** Use **clear labels** so the AI never has to guess whether text is \"an instruction to follow\" or \"content to analyze.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad (ambiguous):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are an expert. Here's code: [code] Check it.\n",
    "```\n",
    "→ Where do instructions end and code begin?\n",

    "<code_to_review>[code block]</code_to_review>\n",
    "<instructions>Check for issues.</instructions>\n",
    "```\n",
    "→ Clear boundaries, zero confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**XML vs Markdown?** Both work! XML gives stricter separation (good for complex prompts with 6+ sections). Markdown is fine for simpler prompts. The key is: **label your sections clearly**, whatever format you choose.\n",

    "**💭 Common Integration Patterns:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 1: IDE Integration** - Use in your code editor  \n",
    "Save as custom or Slash command. Highlight code → Run → Get instant review. Examples: Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2: GitLab/GitHub CI/CD** - Automated reviews  \n",
    "Add to CI pipeline. Runs on every merge request. Posts findings as comments. Can block merges if CRITICAL\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 3: Pre-commit Hook** - Local validation  \n",
    "Runs when you git commit. Fast feedback (catches issues in seconds). No CI needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 4: Custom Slack Bot / CLI** - Team tool  \n",
    "Run commands in terminal or Slack. Great for ad-hoc reviews during pairing\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**🧪 For This Tutorial:** We're focusing on **building the template** itself. Integration with your specific tools (GitLab, IDE, etc.) comes after — but the template you build here works across all platforms!\n",
