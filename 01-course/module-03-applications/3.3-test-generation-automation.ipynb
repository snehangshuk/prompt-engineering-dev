    "- Vague terms: What does \"max 3 attempts\" mean? Immediate retries? Delays between attempts?\n",
    "- Missing specs: What happens when a discount exceeds the cart total?\n",
    "- Unstated assumptions: Are refunds partial or full? How do currency conversions work?\n",

    "**2. Comprehensive Coverage**\n",
    "- **Happy paths:** Valid payment with USD in a single currency\n",
    "- **Edge cases:** Boundary values (0% discount, 100% discount, exactly $0.01 remaining)\n",
    "- **Error scenarios:** Payment gateway timeout, invalid currency code, expired cards\n",
    "- **Security tests:** Card data encryption, PCI compliance, injection attacks\n",
    "- **Integration points:** Email service failures, audit log corruption\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Test Type Separation**\n",
    "- **Unit tests:** Discount calculation logic (pure functions, fast, no external dependencies)\n",
    "- **Integration tests:** Full payment flow (database, payment gateway, email service)\n",
    "- **Why this matters:** Unit tests run in milliseconds during development; integration tests run in CI/CD\n",
