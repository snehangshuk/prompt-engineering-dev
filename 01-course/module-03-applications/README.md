# Module 3: Applications ⭐ Optional

## Real-World Applications

Automate code review, test generation, and quality checks using production-ready prompt templates.

> **📌 Note:** This module is **optional**. Modules 1 and 2 provide the core prompt engineering skills needed for most development tasks. Module 3 focuses on advanced production workflows and can be completed when you're ready to build reusable templates for your team.

### Learning Objectives
By completing this module, you will be able to:
- Build automated code review templates that catch security and quality issues
- Create test generation prompts for unit and integration tests
- Design reusable templates for different codebases and teams
- Build evaluation templates with scoring rubrics (advanced)
- Integrate automated quality gates into CI/CD pipelines (advanced)

### Getting Started

**First time here?** 
- If you haven't set up your development environment yet, follow the [Quick Setup guide](../../README.md#-quick-setup) in the main README first
- **New to Jupyter notebooks?** Read [About Jupyter Notebooks](../../README.md#-about-jupyter-notebooks) to understand how notebooks work and where code executes

> **⚠️ Important**: You must clone this repository and run notebooks locally. They cannot be executed directly from GitHub/GitLab.

**Ready to start?**
1. **Open the tutorial notebook**: Click on [3.1-setup-and-introduction.ipynb](./3.1-setup-and-introduction.ipynb) to start
2. **Install dependencies**: Run the "Install Required Dependencies" cell in the notebook
3. **Follow the notebooks**: Work through sections 3.1 → 3.3 (and optionally 3.4) in order
4. **Complete exercises**: Practice the hands-on activities as you go

> **Note:** Like Module 2, Module 3 is organized as multiple linked sections. Work through them in order:

### Core Sections (Complete These First)
- **[Section 3.1](./3.1-setup-and-introduction.ipynb)** – Environment setup, provider validation, and module orientation
- **[Section 3.2](./3.2-code-review-automation.ipynb)** – Code review automation patterns with parameterized templates
- **[Section 3.3](./3.3-test-generation-automation.ipynb)** – Test generation automation for translating requirements into suites

### Advanced Section (Optional)
- **[Section 3.4](./3.4-evaluation-templates.ipynb)** ⭐ **Advanced (Optional)** – Evaluation templates, rubric design, and systematic evals

> **💡 Recommended Path:** Complete core sections 3.1-3.3 first (95 minutes) for essential SDLC automation skills. Section 3.4 is optional—return to it when you need production-grade quality gates and systematic evaluation.

### Module Contents

**Core Notebooks:**
- **[3.1-setup-and-introduction.ipynb](./3.1-setup-and-introduction.ipynb)** – Environment checks and provider validation
- **[3.2-code-review-automation.ipynb](./3.2-code-review-automation.ipynb)** – Comprehensive code review workflows
- **[3.3-test-generation-automation.ipynb](./3.3-test-generation-automation.ipynb)** – Requirement-to-test prompt patterns

**Advanced:**
- **[3.4-evaluation-templates.ipynb](./3.4-evaluation-templates.ipynb)** – Rubrics and automated quality gates

**Supporting Materials:**
- **[activities/](./activities/)** – Practice briefs and instructions (`activities/README.md`)
- **[solutions/](./solutions/)** – Reference templates with deep-dive explanations
- **setup_utils.py** – Shared helpers for configuring AI providers and testing templates

### Time Required
**Core sections (3.1-3.3):** 95 minutes (~1.5 hours)  
**With optional advanced section (3.4):** 135 minutes (~2.25 hours)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed
- IDE with notebook support (VS Code or Cursor recommended)
- API access to GitHub Copilot, CircuIT, or OpenAI

### Next Steps
After completing this module:
1. Review and refine your solutions to the exercises in this module
2. Apply your templates to real project code
3. Compare your work with the solutions directory to identify improvement ideas
