    "Let's dissect the judge template you saw in action. We'll walk through each block and see how it uses Module 2 tactics:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Block 1: 🎭 Set the Judge Persona\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it looked like:**\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<role>\n",
    "You are a Principal Engineer reviewing AI-generated code feedback.\n",
    "</role>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this does:** Activates expert evaluation standards. Instead of generic \"looks good/bad\" judgments, you get analysis a Principal Engineer would apply—understanding what makes feedback production-ready vs. needing revision.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module 2 Tactic:** Role Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Block 2: 🔢 Define Weighted Rubric (What to Evaluate)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it looked like:**\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<rubric>\n",
    "1. Accuracy (40%): Do identified issues actually exist and are correctly described?\n",
    "2. Completeness (30%): Are major concerns covered? Any critical issues missed?\n",
    "3. Actionability (20%): Are recommendations specific and implementable?\n",
    "4. Communication (10%): Is the review professional, clear, and well-structured?\n",
    "</rubric>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this does:** Creates a systematic multi-dimensional checklist with explicit priorities. Accuracy gets highest weight (40%) because factually wrong reviews are worse than poorly formatted ones. Every evaluation checks ALL 4 dimensions—no skipped criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module 2 Tactic:** Task Decomposition + Weighted Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Block 3: 🧠 Guide the Evaluation Process (How to Score)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it looked like:**\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<instructions>\n",
    "Score each criterion 1-5 with detailed rationale:\n",
    "- 5: Excellent - Exceeds expectations\n",
    "- 4: Good - Meets expectations with minor gaps\n",
    "- 3: Acceptable - Meets minimum bar\n",
    "- 2: Needs work - Significant gaps\n",
    "- 1: Unacceptable - Fails to meet standards\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate weighted total: (Accuracy×0.4) + (Completeness×0.3) + (Actionability×0.2) + (Communication×0.1)\n",

    "- REJECT (<2.5): Start over with different approach\n",
    "</instructions>\n",
    "```\n",

    "<submission>\n",
    "{{llm_output_under_review}}\n",
    "</submission>\n",
    "```\n",

    "- Recommendation (ACCEPT/REVISE/REJECT)\n",
    "- Specific feedback for improvements\n",
    "</output_format>\n",

    "**1. Weighted Criteria** – Prioritize what matters most (e.g., accuracy first for safety-critical domains).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Explicit Scale** – Clear 1-5 definitions stop the judge from drifting between runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Evidence-Based Rationale** – Forces the model to ground scores in the submission content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Actionable Thresholds** – Numeric gates (3.5, 2.5) enable pipeline automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Improvement Guidance** – \"Revise\" outcomes must include next steps for the generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calibration: Keeping Scores Consistent\n",
    "\n",
    "The rubric defines **what** to score; calibration ensures **how** it's scored stays consistent. Instead of generic \"7/10 - pretty good\" language, define anchors:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** 7/10 = factually accurate with minor gaps, clear structure, appropriate for target audience, missing 1-2 implementation details.\n",

    "Manual testing validates one case. **Evals** validate your judge across hundreds of cases and track metrics:\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Does your judge correctly identify good vs bad refactors?\n",
    "- **False positives**: How often does it block acceptable changes?\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Does rubric v2 improve on v1?\n",

    "#### Quick Start\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Build an eval dataset**: Collect 10-20 refactors with known verdicts\n",
    "2. **Run systematic evals**: Test your judge template against the dataset\n",
    "3. **Track metrics**: Measure accuracy, iterate on rubric weights\n",
    "4. **Compare models**: Test if GPT-4o vs Claude performs better as judge\n",
