## 🎯 The 4 Core Elements

| Element | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Instructions** | Define role and task | "You are a senior engineer conducting code review" |
| **Context** | Provide background | "This is a user registration function for a web app" |
| **Input Data** | Give specific content | The actual code to review |
| **Output Format** | Specify structure | "1) Security Issues, 2) Code Quality, 3) Improvements" |

**Key insight:** Every effective prompt uses some or all of these elements!

## 🤔 Quick FAQ

**Q: Can I skip to Module 2?**
Module 2 assumes you know the 4 elements. Complete this first (only 20 min!).

**Q: What if I don't understand something?**
Each concept has multiple examples. Try them all in Circuit.

**Q: Should I take notes?**
Yes! Note which elements you tend to forget—helps in Module 2.
