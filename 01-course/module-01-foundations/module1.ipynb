    "## Why Prompt Engineering for Software Engineers?\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Prompt Engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering is how you control LLM output. You give the model instructions, questions, or statements, and it adjusts its behavior to match what you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improve model accuracy and safety\n",
    "- Add domain knowledge and external tools without fine-tuning\n",
    "- Understand model capabilities through structured interaction\n",
    "- Get better results by writing better inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Ways to Influence LLM Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Fine-tuning (Traditional Approach)**\n",
    "- Adjusts model weights using training data\n",
    "- Expensive: requires significant compute time and cost\n",
    "- Limited flexibility: model locked into specific behavior patterns\n",
    "- Problem: Still produces vague, inconsistent results without proper context\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Prompt Engineering vs. Context Engineering**\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [Anthropic's engineering team](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents), there's an important distinction:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prompt Engineering** refers to methods for writing and organizing LLM instructions for optimal outcomes\n",
    "- **Context Engineering** refers to the set of strategies for curating and maintaining the optimal set of information during LLM inference, including all the other information that may land there outside of the prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Difference:** Prompt engineering focuses on writing effective prompts, while context engineering manages the entire information available to the model (system instructions, tools, external data, message history, etc.) as a finite resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Concept** | **What It Manages** | **Scope** | **Example** |\n",
    "|-------------|---------------------|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Prompt Engineering** | Writing effective instructions | How you structure your questions and instructions | \"You are a security expert. Review this authentication code for vulnerabilities. Format response as: [Security Issues], [Fixes], [Priority]\" |\n",
    "| **Context Engineering** | Managing the entire context window | Everything the model sees: prompts + tools + external data + conversation history | Managing which information to include: current prompt + relevant code files + API documentation + conversation history + tool definitions + external data sources |\n",
    "| **Traditional Prompting** | Nothing - just asks vague questions | No structure or management | \"Fix this code\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "**This course focuses on Prompt Engineering** - writing instructions that produce consistent, high-quality results. Context Engineering is broader and applies when building production AI systems that manage large amounts of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Prompt Engineering Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Poorly written prompts produce bad results, even with perfect context management. Prompt engineering teaches you to write clear, specific instructions that work whether you're chatting with an AI assistant or building a production system.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional Prompting (❌ Vague):**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "User: \"Fix this code\"\n",
    "\n",
    "AI: \"I'd be happy to help! Could you please share the code you'd like me to fix?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt Engineering (✅ Structured Instructions):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "User: \"You are a senior Python developer. Review this e-commerce checkout function. \n",
    "Requirements: Handle empty lists, add type hints, include error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "def calculate_total(items): \n",
    "    return sum(items)\n",
    "\n",
    "Format response as: 1) Issues Found, 2) Fixed Code, 3) Tests\"\n",
    "\n",
    "AI: [Provides structured analysis with all requested sections]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context Engineering (Managing the Full Context):**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "System manages all available information including:\n",
    "- Your prompt (above) \n",
    "- Relevant code files from the repository\n",
    "- API documentation\n",
    "- Previous conversation history\n",
    "- Available tools (code_analyzer, test_runner)\n",
    "- External data sources\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses ALL of this to generate a response, but your PROMPT determines \n",
    "the quality and structure of that response.\n",

    "## Elements of a Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompts contain some or all of these five elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Role (Persona)** \n",
    "\n",
    "Defining who the AI should act as shapes its expertise, perspective, and response quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:**\n",
    "- Activates domain-specific knowledge (\"security expert\" prioritizes vulnerabilities)\n",
    "- Sets expertise level (junior dev vs. senior architect)\n",
    "- Changes perspective (code reviewer vs. performance optimizer)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What makes a strong role:**\n",
    "- Expertise level: senior, principal, experienced\n",
    "- Domain: Python developer, security engineer, DevOps specialist\n",
    "- Specialization: \"with expertise in async programming,\" \"specializing in authentication\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Weak | Strong |\n",
    "|------|--------|\n",
    "| \"You are a programmer\" | \"You are a senior Python developer specializing in async programming\" |\n",
    "| \"Review this code\" | \"You are a security engineer reviewing financial application code\" |\n",
    "| \"Help me debug\" | \"You are a principal engineer debugging distributed systems\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Without role:*\n",
    "```text\n",
    "User: \"Review this authentication code\"\n",
    "AI: \"The code looks okay, but you might want to add some error handling.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*With role:*\n",
    "```text\n",
    "User: \"You are a security engineer. Review this authentication code.\"\n",
    "AI: \"CRITICAL: Timing attack vulnerability. Use secrets.compare_digest() \n",
    "for password comparison. No rate limiting detected—vulnerable to brute force...\"\n",
    "```\n",

    "Module 2 covers role prompting in depth (Tactic 1), including role switching and domain-specific personas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Instructions**\n",
    "The specific task for the AI to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** \"Analyze the provided code and identify potential security issues.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Context**\n",
    "External information to guide the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** \"Code context: This is a utility function for user registration in a web application.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Input Data**\n",
    "The input for which you want a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** \"Code to review: `def register_user(email, password): ...`\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Output Indicator**\n",
    "The output type or format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** \"Please provide your response in this format: 1) Security Issues, 2) Code Quality Issues, 3) Recommended Improvements, 4) Overall Assessment\"\n",

    "## Evaluate and Iterate\n",
    "\n",
    "Review model responses and adjust prompts as needed. Prompt engineering is iterative—practice builds intuition.\n",
