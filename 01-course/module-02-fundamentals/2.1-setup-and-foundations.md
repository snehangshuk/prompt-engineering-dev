| **Aspect** | **Details** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Goal** | Master clear instructions (Tactic 0) and understand prompt structure basics |
| **Time** | ~15 minutes |
| **Prerequisites** | Access to AI chat web interface (internal Cisco Circuit, ChatGPT Plus, etc.) |
| **Next Steps** | Continue to Section 2.2: Roles and Structure |

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you'll be able to:
- ✅ Write clear, specific instructions that eliminate ambiguity
- ✅ Structure prompts with system and user messages
- ✅ Transform vague requests into actionable prompts
- ✅ Apply specificity to get better AI outputs

---

## 🎬 Tactic 0: Write Clear Instructions

**Transform generic requests into specific, actionable prompts**

Clear instructions form the foundation of all other tactics. Think of AI models as brilliant but very new employees—they need explicit instructions including context, specific requirements, and sequential steps.

**Core Principle:** If a colleague would be confused without context, the AI will be too.

---

### 📝 Example 1: Vague vs. Specific Instructions

**Copy this to Circuit (Vague Version):**

```
Help me choose a programming language for my project
```

**❌ Problem:** Too generic. AI doesn't know your requirements, constraints, or goals.

---

**Copy this to Circuit (Specific Version):**

```
I need to choose a programming language for building a real-time chat application that will handle 10,000 concurrent users, needs to integrate with a PostgreSQL database, and must be deployable on AWS. The team has 3 years of experience with web development. Provide the top 3 language recommendations with pros and cons for each.
```

**✅ Self-Check: Your response should include:**
- [ ] Exactly 3 language recommendations
- [ ] Pros and cons for each language
- [ ] Considerations for real-time handling
- [ ] Database integration considerations
- [ ] AWS deployment factors

---

### 📝 Example 2: Using System Prompts for Context

**Understanding System Prompts:**
- **System message:** Sets overarching instructions and behavioral guidelines
- **User message:** Contains the actual question or task
- Think of system prompts as "rules of engagement" for the conversation

**Copy this to Circuit:**

```
SYSTEM CONTEXT: You are a senior technical architect. Provide concise, actionable recommendations in bullet format. Focus only on the most critical factors for the decision. No lengthy explanations.

USER REQUEST: Help me choose between microservices and monolithic architecture for a startup with 5 developers building a fintech application.
```

**✅ Self-Check: Your response should:**
- [ ] Be in bullet format (concise)
- [ ] Focus on critical factors only
- [ ] Avoid lengthy theoretical explanations
- [ ] Consider team size and fintech context

**💡 Key Insight:** System context shapes HOW the AI responds, not just WHAT it responds with.

---

## 🎯 Activity 1.1: Try It Yourself - Clear Instructions

**Scenario:** You need to optimize a slow database query but your initial request is too vague.

### Step 1: See the Vague Prompt Problem

**Copy this to Circuit:**

```
Help me optimize my database
```

**Note what the AI says... it will likely ask YOU clarifying questions!**

---

### Step 2: Transform with Specific Instructions

**Now copy this to Circuit (same chat or new chat):**

```
I have a PostgreSQL database for an e-commerce site with 1 million products. The product search query is taking 5+ seconds. Here's the current query:

SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%search_term%' OR description LIKE '%search_term%'

Context:
- Database has 1 million product records
- Current query time: 5+ seconds
- Need to reduce to under 1 second
- Must support partial text matching
- Cannot change database schema (production constraint)

Requirements:
- Provide top 3 optimization techniques
- Explain expected performance improvement for each
- Include implementation steps
- Prioritize solutions that don't require schema changes

Format response as:
1. Technique name
2. Implementation steps
3. Expected performance improvement
4. Potential trade-offs
```

### 📊 Self-Evaluation Checklist

Compare both responses. The specific version should:
- [ ] Provide exactly 3 optimization techniques
- [ ] Include concrete implementation steps
- [ ] Mention specific technologies (indexes, full-text search, etc.)
- [ ] Provide performance metrics or estimates
- [ ] Respect the "no schema changes" constraint

**Score yourself:**
- **5/5 checks** = Excellent! Specificity made a huge difference ✅
- **3-4/5 checks** = Good, the specific version is more actionable
- **0-2/5 checks** = Try adding more context about your current setup

## 💡 Key Principles for Clear Instructions

### The "Colleague Test"
Show your prompt to a colleague with minimal context. If they're confused, the AI will be too.

### Elements of Clear Instructions
1. **Context:** What is the situation?
2. **Constraints:** What limitations exist?
3. **Requirements:** What must the solution include?
4. **Format:** How should the output be structured?
5. **Specifics:** Numbers, technologies, timelines

### Before vs. After Examples

| Vague ❌ | Specific ✅ |
|----------|-------------|
| "Review my code" | "Review this Python function for SQL injection vulnerabilities and suggest parameterized query alternatives" |
| "Help with Docker" | "Create a Dockerfile for a Node.js 18 Express app that runs on port 3000, with environment variables from .env file" |
| "Explain microservices" | "Explain when to choose microservices over monolithic architecture for a team of 8 developers building a SaaS product with 5 main features" |

## 💡 Key Takeaways

### When to Be Extra Specific
✅ Complex technical decisions (architecture, technology choices)
✅ Code generation or refactoring
✅ Troubleshooting production issues
✅ API integration or configuration
✅ Security-sensitive tasks

### Best Practices Learned
1. **Include numbers** - "10,000 users" vs "many users"
2. **Name technologies** - "PostgreSQL" vs "a database"
3. **State constraints explicitly** - "Cannot change schema" vs hoping AI assumes it
4. **Specify output format** - "Bullet points" vs letting AI choose
5. **Provide context** - "For a startup with 5 developers" vs generic advice

## 🤔 Troubleshooting

**Q: The AI's response is still too generic**
**A:** Try these fixes:
1. Add more specific numbers and metrics
2. Name the exact technologies you're using
3. Include your constraints explicitly
4. Specify the exact format you want (bullets, code, steps, etc.)

**Q: I'm not sure what details to include**
**A:** Use this checklist:
- [ ] What is the goal?
- [ ] What constraints exist?
- [ ] What technologies are involved?
- [ ] What scale/size (users, data, team)?
- [ ] What format do I want the output in?

**Q: Can I use this with Cisco's internal Circuit?**
**A:** Yes! These prompts work with any AI chat interface. Just copy-paste the text between the code blocks.
