    "### Tactic 3: Few-Shot Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Teach AI your preferred styles and standards through carefully crafted examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing examples is your secret weapon for consistent, accurate outputs. This technique (called \"few-shot\" or \"multishot\" prompting) is especially effective for structured outputs and specific formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Few-Shot Terminology:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of \"shots\" = how many examples you provide:\n",
    "- **Zero-shot:** No examples (instructions only)\n",
    "- **One-shot:** Single example\n",
    "- **Few-shot:** 2-5 examples (sweet spot for most tasks)\n",
    "- **N-shot:** Many examples for complex patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Examples Work:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Showing AI how you want it to behave (or *not* behave) is powerful for:\n",
    "1. **Clarifies intent:** Demonstrates exact structure and eliminates guesswork\n",
    "2. **Teaches patterns:** AI infers rules you'd struggle to describe explicitly\n",
    "3. **Ensures consistency:** Locks in format across all responses\n",
    "\n",
    "**When This Matters for Engineers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Few-shot examples are particularly valuable when writing custom agent skills - reusable AI capabilities like a \"code-review\" skill that follows your team's checklist. Instead of describing output format in prose, show 2-3 concrete examples and the AI matches your pattern exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices:**\n",
    "- Mirror your actual use case\n",
    "- Include 3-5 diverse examples for best results\n",
    "- Wrap in `<example>` tags (or `<examples>` for multiple)\n",
    "- Cover edge cases without creating unintended patterns\n",
    "- More examples = better performance for complex tasks\n",

    "This example demonstrates how **few-shot learning differs from role prompting**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Role Prompting (Tactic 1):** Assigns AI a *persona* or *expertise* (e.g., \"You are a security engineer\") → Focuses on domain knowledge and perspective\n",
    "- **Few-Shot Examples (Tactic 3):** Teaches AI a *pattern* or *style* through concrete examples → Focuses on format, structure, and consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Mechanism:**\n",
    "- The `system` message \"Answer in a consistent style using the examples provided\" primes the AI to look for patterns\n",
    "- The `user`/`assistant` pairs demonstrate the desired input-output relationship\n",
    "- The AI learns: \"concise format,\" \"specific structure,\" \"technical accuracy\" from seeing 2-3 examples\n",
    "- When given a new question, it applies the learned pattern automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Both Matter:**\n",
    "- Use role prompting when you need **specialized knowledge** (security vulnerabilities, performance optimization)\n",
    "- Use few-shot examples when you need **consistent formatting** (commit messages, error patterns, documentation style)\n",
    "- Combine both for powerful results: \"You are a senior engineer\" (role) + 3 examples of your team's code review format (pattern)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative Format: Using `<example>` XML Tags**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Guide AI through systematic step-by-step problem breakdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Principle:** When faced with complex tasks like research, analysis, or problem-solving, having AI models break down problems into explicit, sequential steps dramatically improves performance. This technique, known as chain of thought (CoT) prompting, encourages the AI to work through problems methodically rather than jumping straight to conclusions, leading to more accurate and nuanced outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like showing your work in math class—by making the intermediate reasoning steps visible, you catch errors, verify logic, and produce more reliable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Works:**\n",
    "- **Accuracy:** Breaking problems into steps reduces errors in logic, math, and multi-factor analysis\n",
    "- **Debugging:** Visible reasoning helps pinpoint where prompts are unclear or logic breaks down\n",
    "- **Transparency:** Makes AI decision-making auditable and explainable\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use CoT:**\n",
    "- Use for tasks that a human would need to think through carefully\n",
    "- Examples: complex math, multi-step analysis, writing complex documents, decisions with many factors\n",
    "- Especially valuable for: debugging workflows, architectural decisions, security analysis, test generation\n",
    "- **Note:** Increased output length may impact latency, so use judiciously\n",
    "\n",
    "**When This Matters for Engineers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain-of-thought is particularly valuable when writing custom agent skills that perform complex analysis - like \"security-audit\" or \"debug-production-issue\" skills. By structuring your skill to output its reasoning explicitly, you make the agent's decisions auditable and catch errors early.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Implement CoT (from least to most complex):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic prompt:** Include \"Think step-by-step\" in your prompt\n",
    "2. **Guided prompt:** Outline specific steps for the AI to follow in its thinking process  \n",
    "3. **Structured prompt:** Use XML tags like `<thinking>` and `<answer>` to separate reasoning from the final answer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** Always have the AI output its thinking. Without outputting its thought process, no thinking occurs!\n",

This technique is especially powerful when working with extended context windows.\n",

    "**Why This Works:**\n",
    "- The AI identifies and focuses on relevant information before generating responses\n",

    "When dealing with extremely long documents (100+ pages of API docs, architectural diagrams, ERDs), manually extracting key information is impractical. Instead, use prompt chaining to create reusable summaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The two-step workflow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First prompt - Generate summary:** \"Read this 200-page API specification and extract only the authentication methods, required fields, and error codes into a 2-page markdown summary\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Second prompt - Use summary:** Reference the condensed summary in your actual implementation prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use this technique:**\n",
    "- **Long API documentation:** 100+ page specifications → 3-5 page summaries with endpoints, auth, required fields\n",
    "- **Database schemas/ERDs:** Complex diagrams → Structured markdown with table relationships and constraints\n",
    "- **Architecture documents:** Lengthy design docs → Key decisions, integration points, and constraints\n",
    "- **Legacy codebases:** Large file sets → Summaries of core patterns, conventions, and critical functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example workflow:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Step 1: Generate summary (one-time setup)\n",
    "Prompt: \"Analyze this 150-page Kubernetes API documentation and create a \n",
    "5-page reference covering: authentication, pod specs, service configuration, \n",

    "Prompt: \"@docs/kubernetes-summary.md - Using this reference, \n",
    "create a pod configuration for a Python web app with health checks\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach combines reference citations (grounding) with prompt chaining (multi-step workflow) to dramatically reduce token usage while maintaining accuracy. The summary becomes a reusable asset for your team.\n",
