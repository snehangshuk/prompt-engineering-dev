## 🎯 What You'll Master

Learn the tactics professional developers use for consistent, high-quality results:
- Transform AI into domain experts (security, QA, architecture)
- Organize complex scenarios with structured formats
- Apply systematic reasoning for debugging
- Build multi-step workflows and self-correction loops
- Evaluate and improve outputs automatically

**Time:** 90-120 minutes | **Format:** 5 progressive sections with activities

## 📚 The 8 Tactics

| Tactic | What It Does | When to Use |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **0. Clear Instructions** | Eliminate ambiguity | Always (foundation) |
| **1. Role Prompting** | Turn AI into specialists | Need domain expertise |
| **2. Structured Inputs** | Organize with XML tags | Multi-file analysis |
| **3. Few-Shot Examples** | Teach your style | Enforce consistency |
| **4. Chain-of-Thought** | Systematic reasoning | Debugging, RCA |
| **5. Reference Citations** | Ground in docs | API integration |
| **6. Prompt Chaining** | Sequential workflows | Complex tasks (90%) |
| **7. Tree of Thoughts** | Explore alternatives | Critical decisions (10%) |
| **8. LLM-as-Judge** | Auto-evaluation | Quality gates |

## 💡 Powerful Combinations

Tactics work best when combined:

- **Role + Structure** → Security reviews with organized files
- **Few-Shot + CoT** → Consistent format with systematic reasoning
- **Citations + Chaining** → Accurate API implementation step-by-step
- **Chaining + Judge** → High-quality code with auto-validation
- **ToT + Judge** → Explore alternatives, select best objectively

## 🎯 Quick Reference

### When to Use Each Tactic

**Every prompt:** Tactic 0 (Clear Instructions)
**Most common:** Tactics 1, 2, 4, 6 (Role, Structure, CoT, Chaining)
**Situational:** Tactics 3, 5, 7, 8 (Few-Shot, Citations, ToT, Judge)

### Decision Framework

- **Need expertise?** → Role Prompting (Tactic 1)
- **Complex files?** → Structured Inputs (Tactic 2)
- **Enforce format?** → Few-Shot Examples (Tactic 3)
- **Debug/analyze?** → Chain-of-Thought (Tactic 4)
- **Use docs?** → Reference Citations (Tactic 5)
- **Multi-step task?** → Prompt Chaining (Tactic 6)
- **Critical choice?** → Tree of Thoughts (Tactic 7)
- **Need quality check?** → LLM-as-Judge (Tactic 8)

## ✅ Success Criteria

Ready for Module 3 when you can:
- ✅ Name all 8 tactics and when to use each
- ✅ Apply tactics independently without hints
- ✅ Combine tactics for common tasks
- ✅ Evaluate prompts to identify which tactics were used

**Self-test:** How would you...
- Review code for security? → Role + Structure + CoT
- Implement from API docs? → Citations + Chaining
- Choose between 3 approaches? → ToT + Judge

## 🤔 Quick FAQ

**Q: Can I skip sections?**
No—Section 2.5 tests all tactics. Complete in order.

**Q: Which tactics are most important?**
Always use Tactics 0-1. Very common: 2, 4, 6. Situational: 3, 5, 7, 8.

**Q: How much time between sections?**
Take 5-minute breaks. Better: One section per day.

**Q: Do tactics work with other languages?**
Yes! Examples use Python, but tactics work with any language.
