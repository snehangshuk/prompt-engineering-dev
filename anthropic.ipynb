      "SPECIFIC REQUEST RESULT:\n",
      "Based on your requirements, here are my top 3 recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. **Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript)**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pros:**\n",
      "- **Excellent real-time capabilities** with WebSockets and Socket.io\n",
      "- **Event-driven, non-blocking I/O** perfect for chat applications\n",
      "- **Massive ecosystem** with mature PostgreSQL drivers (pg, Prisma)\n",
      "- **Easy AWS deployment** with extensive documentation and tooling\n",
      "- **Low learning curve** if team has web development experience\n",
      "- **Single language** for frontend and backend\n",
      "- **Great horizontal scaling** capabilities\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cons:**\n",
      "- **Single-threaded** nature can be limiting for CPU-intensive tasks\n",
      "- **Memory usage** can grow with many concurrent connections\n",
      "- **Callback complexity** (mitigated with async/await and TypeScript)\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. **Go (Golang)**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pros:**\n",
      "- **Exceptional concurrency** with goroutines - ideal for 10k concurrent users\n",
      "- **Excellent performance** and low memory footprint\n",
      "- **Built-in WebSocket support** and strong real-time capabilities\n",
      "- **Robust PostgreSQL drivers** (pgx, GORM)\n",
      "- **Easy AWS deployment** with small binary sizes\n",
      "- **Strong typing** and excellent error handling\n",
      "- **Great scalability** for high-concurrency applications\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cons:**\n",
      "- **Steeper learning curve** - new syntax and concepts for web developers\n",
      "- **Smaller ecosystem** compared to Node.js\n",
      "- **Less familiar** to teams with primarily web development background\n",
      "- **Verbose syntax** compared to other modern languages\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. **Python (with FastAPI + asyncio)**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pros:**\n",
      "- **Familiar syntax** - easier transition for web developers\n",
      "- **Excellent async capabilities** with asyncio and FastAPI\n",
      "- **Mature PostgreSQL ecosystem** (asyncpg, SQLAlchemy)\n",
      "- **Good AWS support** with extensive libraries\n",
      "- **Strong WebSocket support** through FastAPI or separate libraries\n",
      "- **Rich ecosystem** and extensive documentation\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cons:**\n",
      "- **Performance limitations** compared to Go or Node.js\n",
      "- **GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)** can limit true parallelism\n",
      "- **Higher memory usage** under heavy concurrent load\n",
      "- **May require more optimization** for 10k concurrent users\n",
      "\n",
      "## **Recommendation: Node.js**\n",
      "\n",
      "For your specific case, I'd recommend **Node.js** because:\n",
      "- Your team's web development experience translates directly\n",
      "- It's specifically designed for real-time, I/O-intensive applications\n",
      "- Proven track record with chat applications (Discord, WhatsApp Web)\n",
      "- Fastest time-to-market given your team's background\n",
      "- Excellent AWS ecosystem support\n",
      "\n",
      "Start with Node.js/TypeScript and consider Go if you need to optimize for performance later.\n"
