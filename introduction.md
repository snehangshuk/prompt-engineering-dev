## 🚀 Start Learning

**Requirements:** Just an AI chat interface (Circuit, ChatGPT, etc.) and a browser. No installation needed.

## 📚 Learning Path

### **👉 [Module 1: Foundations](./01-course/module-01-foundations/module1.md)** (20 min)
Learn the 4 core elements that make every prompt effective: Instructions, Context, Input Data, and Output Format.

### **Module 2: Core Techniques** (90-120 min)
Master 8 proven tactics through hands-on practice:

## 💡 How It Works

**1. Read** - Each section explains a tactic with examples
**2. Copy** - Every prompt is formatted for direct use in Circuit
**3. Try** - Paste prompts into your AI interface and observe results
**4. Practice** - Complete activities with self-check criteria
**5. Master** - Track your skills with built-in checklists

**Example format:**
```
Copy this to Circuit:

You are a senior engineer reviewing code for security issues.
Review this authentication function...
```

After each example, verify your results:
- ✅ Identified SQL injection
- ✅ Suggested parameterized queries
- ✅ Provided code fixes

## 🤔 FAQ

**Q: Do I need Python knowledge?**
No. While examples use Python, tactics work with any programming language.

**Q: Will this work with Circuit?**
Yes! All prompts work with Circuit, ChatGPT, Claude, or any AI chat interface.

**Q: Can I skip sections?**
Complete them in order—each builds on previous concepts.

**Q: How do I know I'm doing it right?**
Each activity has 5 success criteria. Meeting 4-5 means you're ready to continue.

**Q: Have API access?**
Use the interactive `.ipynb` notebooks instead. See the [main README](./README.md) for setup.
