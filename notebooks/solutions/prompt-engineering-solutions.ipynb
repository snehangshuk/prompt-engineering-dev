            "### Key Improvements:\n",
            "1. **Input Validation**: Added checks to ensure all inputs are valid (e.g., non-negative numbers, non-empty lists).\n",
            "2. **Type Hints**: Used Python's `typing` module to specify the types of parameters and return value.\n",
            "3. **Edge Case Handling**: Handled cases like empty lists, `None` values, and negative numbers.\n",
            "4. **Improved Variable Names**: Renamed variables for better clarity (`items` → `item_prices`, `tax` → `tax_rate`, etc.).\n",
            "5. **Docstring**: Added a detailed docstring explaining the function's purpose, arguments, return value, and potential exceptions.\n",
            "6. **Decimal Precision**: Used Python's `decimal.Decimal` for precise currency calculations and rounded to two decimal places.\n",
            "7. **Percentage-Based Tax**: Changed the tax calculation to be percentage-based instead of a fixed amount.\n",
